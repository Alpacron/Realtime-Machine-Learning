<p align="center">An implementation of object recognition and AI in the environment of a game called Valorant.</p>
<br><br>

## Implementation
I decided to make an interactive desktop application which records the game, executes actions in the game and visualises the environment state.

> The latest release of the desktop application can be found: [here](/releases/latest)

> The current backend environment is setup on a vm in netlab on: [192.168.240.10](http://192.168.240.10)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Valorant (game)
- Node

### Setup
To run the whole backend server on microk8s see the [k8s cluster setup](./kubernetes/README.md) document.

Then run the client app and valorant on your local machine:
